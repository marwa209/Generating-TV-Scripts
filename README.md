# Generating-TV-Scripts
Generating TV Scripts using Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
# Project Overview
this project is my third project in Deep Learnig Nanodegree in Udacity and one of the most intersting project i have done. In this project, I have generated my own Simpsons TV scripts using RNNs. I have used part of the Simpsons dataset of scripts from many seasons. The Neural Network I have built will generate a new, "fake" TV script. and in this project many concepts are coverd like Recurrent Neural Networks, Tensorflow, Embeddings and Word2Vec.
# Steps to do the job
1- Get and explore the Data
2- preprocess the data
3- create Lookup Table, give tokens to the words
4- save the data
5- Build the Neural Network
6- modeling and training the network
7- tuning the hyperparameters
8- Generate TV Script
9- Generate Text and new script
