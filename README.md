# Generating-TV-Scripts
Generating TV Scripts using Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
# Project Overview
this project is my third project in Deep Learnig Nanodegree in Udacity and one of the most intersting project i have done. In this project, I have generated my own Simpsons TV scripts using RNNs. I have used part of the Simpsons dataset of scripts from many seasons. The Neural Network I have built will generate a new, "fake" TV script. and in this project many concepts are coverd like Recurrent Neural Networks, Tensorflow, Embeddings and Word2Vec.
